# Python FPS

* Install pip if not already installed: `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`
* Install PIL for the images: `sudo pip3 install pillow`
* Install OpenGL: `sudo pip3 install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate`

## Usage

I don't know how to run it. I guess it works if you do `python3 Level.py` or make it executable.
